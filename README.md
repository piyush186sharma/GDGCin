Good evening bhaiya/didi,
My name is Piyush Sharma[2414146] and i have made an User Authentication system using nodemon,mongoose and express. This is my Backend API which receives 3 values name,email and password to signup. I have also used bcrypt for password hashing. I have used Mongodb for data storage. To deploy this project we just need to run the command "npm start" in vscode terminal.
